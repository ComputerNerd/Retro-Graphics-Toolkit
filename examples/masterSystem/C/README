This example uses https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS. I decided not to include
the library because it may be updated and I may not be aware of this. I do not
want to host an old version of the library. To compile place crt0_sms.rel,
SMSlib.lib, SMSlib.h and peep-rules.txt in this folder, run make and it will
compile provided that you have installed SDCC.
