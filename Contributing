Especially given what can be accomplished via Lua scripting modifying Retro
Graphics Toolkit to suite your needs or writing a Lua script to what you need
to do is much faster and easier than writing your own tool. Why reinvent the
wheel? Instead modify the wheel to suite your needs.

These changes are very likely to benefit other people as well. It is very
likely that after you make a change to Retro Graphics Toolkit or write a Lua
script for it you will want to contribute your changes. Fortunately Github
makes it very easy for you to contribute. All you need to do is fork the
project and submit a pull request. If you do not like that approach you can
also submit a patch.

What if I cannot program but I sill want to help out?
	* Retro Graphics Toolkit is lacking in documentation. Any additional
	  documentation helps.
	* If you do not like writing documentation but want to help
	  out, you can file bug reports if you find any.


What if I want to program something but I am not sure what?
	* Check the development roadmap Wiki page
	* If that does not work I have lots of ideas. I can easily give you one.
