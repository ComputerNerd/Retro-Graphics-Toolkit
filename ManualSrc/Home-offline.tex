There are a few programs that will import art for various Retro consoles
but when it comes to converting art to currently supported systems no
program does it better than Retro Graphics Toolkit.

and importing art to various gaming consoles and embedded devices a
breeze. With its easy to use GUI you can jump right in and if you need
